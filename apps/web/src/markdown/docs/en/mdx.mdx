# Markdown

A translated markdown file is treated as a Document, and is translated as a whole to keep the context of the document.

## Ignoring content

You can ignore content between `<!-- languine-ignore-start -->` and `<!-- languine-ignore-end -->` tags.

```mdx
<!-- languine-ignore-start -->
This content will not be translated.
<!-- languine-ignore-end -->
```
