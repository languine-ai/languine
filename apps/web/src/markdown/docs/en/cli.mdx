## Overrides for source locale

Sometimes you may want to get overrides for the source locale. For example, as a developer you might add translations in en.json but want to have spell checks, overrides and maintain consistent tone with other languages. You can enable this by adding your source locale to the target locales as follows:

```bash title="languine.json"
{
  "locale": {
    "source": "en",
    "targets": [
      "sv",
      "en" <- Add your source locale here
    ]
  },
  "files": {
    "json": {
      "include": [
        "src/locales/[locale]/*.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}

```
