# JSON

Languine supports JSON files as a source format with the common requirements for pluralization and interpolation. This format is used in many frameworks like React, Vue, Ruby on Rails, and more.

## Setting Up

First, make sure you've got a languine.json config file in your project root. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "locale": {
    "source": "en",
    "targets": ["sv", "de", "fr"]
  },
  "files": {
    "json": {
      "include": ["locales/[locale].json"]
    }
  }
}

```

## Translating

With your config set, run:

```bash
npx languine@latest translate
```

When you run this command, Languine will:

- Load your source JSON file (e.g., locales/en.json)
- Detect any new or modified translation strings
- Generate translations for your target languages
- Create or update the target language JSON files (e.g., locales/sv.json, locales/de.json, locales/fr.json)
