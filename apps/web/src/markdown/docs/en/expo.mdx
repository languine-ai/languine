# Expo

Languine supports Expo localization, integrating seamlessly with Expo's i18n system. This format works with both JavaScript and TypeScript projects, supporting nested structures and pluralization.

---

## Setting Up

First, make sure you've got a languine.json config file in your project root. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "locale": {
    "source": "en",
    "targets": ["sv", "de", "fr"]
  },
  "files": {
    "expo": {
      "include": ["assets/locales/[locale].json"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Translating

With your config set, run:

```bash
npx languine@latest translate
```

When you run this command, Languine will:

- Load your source translation file (e.g., assets/locales/en.json)
- Detect any new or modified translation strings
- Generate translations for your target languages
- Create or update the target language files (e.g., assets/locales/sv.json)
- Preserve nested structure and pluralization rules
- Maintain compatibility with expo-localization
