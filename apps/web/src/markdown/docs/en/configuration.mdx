# Configuration

Languine supports both TypeScript and JSON configuration files to manage your translation setup. You can choose either languine.config.ts for TypeScript or languine.config.json for JSON format. Both files define your source and target languages, as well as the files that need to be translated.

---

## Basic Configuration

Here's a basic example in both formats:

```typescript title="languine.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "languine";

export default defineConfig({
  locale: {
    source: "en",
    targets: ["es", "fr", "de"],
  },
  files: {
    json: {
      include: ["locales/[locale].json"],
    },
  },
});
```

```json title="languine.config.json"
{
  "locale": {
    "source": "en",
    "targets": ["es", "fr", "de"]
  },
  "files": {
    "json": {
      "include": ["locales/[locale].json"]
    }
  }
}
```

Both formats support the same configuration options. Choose TypeScript for better type checking and IDE support, or JSON for simplicity and broader tool compatibility.

Let's break down the different sections of these files.

---

## Locale Configuration

The locale section defines your translation languages:

- source: Your primary language for content creation (e.g., "en" for English)
- targets: An array of languages you want to translate into (e.g., ["es", "fr", "de"] for Spanish, French, and German)

Languine supports a wide range of language codes, including:
- Simple codes: en, es, fr, de
- Region-specific codes: pt-BR, zh-CN, zh-TW

## File Configuration

The files section defines which files Languine should translate. You can configure multiple file types and patterns:

---

### JSON Files
```typescript
files: {
  json: {
    include: ["locales/[locale].json"],
  },
}
```

---

### Markdown/MDX Files
```typescript
files: {
  md: {
    include: ["docs/[locale]/*.md"],
  },
  mdx: {
    include: ["blog/[locale]/*.mdx"],
  },
}
```

---

### Mobile Platform Files

For iOS (Xcode):
```typescript
files: {
  "xcode-xcstrings": {
    include: ["Example/Localizable.xcstrings"],
  },
  // Or for traditional .strings files
  "xcode-strings": {
    include: ["Example/[locale].lproj/Localizable.strings"],
  },
}
```

---

For Android:
```typescript
files: {
  android: {
    include: ["locales/[locale].xml"],
  },
}
```

---

### Other Formats

Here's a complete list of file formats supported by Languine:

- [JSON](/docs/json) - Standard JSON translation files
- [YAML](/docs/yaml) - YAML translation files
- [Properties](/docs/properties) - Java properties files
- [Android](/docs/android) - Android XML resource files
- [iOS](/docs/ios) - iOS localization files
- [iOS Stringsdict](/docs/xcode-stringsdict) - iOS pluralization files
- [iOS XCStrings](/docs/xcode-xcstrings) - Modern Xcode string catalogs
- [Markdown](/docs/md) - Documentation files
- [MDX](/docs/mdx) - Documentation with JSX
- [HTML](/docs/html) - HTML files
- [JavaScript](/docs/js) - JavaScript files
- [TypeScript](/docs/ts) - TypeScript files
- [Gettext PO](/docs/po) - GetText translation files
- [XLIFF](/docs/xliff) - XML Localization Interchange File Format
- [CSV](/docs/csv) - Spreadsheet-based translations
- [XML](/docs/xml) - XML resource files
- [Flutter ARB](/docs/arb) - Application Resource Bundle files

---

## File Patterns

The [locale] placeholder in file patterns is automatically replaced with the appropriate language code during translation. For example:

- locales/[locale].json becomes:
  - locales/en.json
  - locales/es.json
  - locales/fr.json

You can include multiple patterns for each file type and use glob patterns:
```typescript
files: {
  json: {
    include: [
      "src/locales/[locale].json",
      "src/components/[locale]/*.json"
    ],
  },
}
```

---

## Project ID (Optional)

If you're using Languine's cloud services, you can include your project ID in the configuration:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  projectId: "prj_your_project_id",
  locale: {
    // ... locale config
  },
  files: {
    // ... files config
  },
});
```

---

## Translation State Tracking

Languine automatically creates and maintains a languine.lock file to track the state of your translations. This file:

- Tracks which content has been translated
- Helps identify what needs to be updated when source content changes
- Should be committed to your version control system

You don't need to manually edit the lock file - Languine manages it automatically when you run translation commands.

## Best Practices

1. **Version Control**: Always commit both languine.config.ts and languine.lock to your repository
2. **File Organization**: Keep your translation files organized in a consistent directory structure
3. **Language Codes**: Use standard language codes to ensure compatibility
4. **Patterns**: Use specific include patterns to avoid translating unnecessary files
5. **Project ID**: Keep your project ID secure and don't share it publicly if you're using cloud services, use the `LANGUINE_PROJECT_ID` environment variable instead.
