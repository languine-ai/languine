# Xcode Stringsdict

Languine supports Xcode's Stringsdict format, used for complex pluralization rules in iOS and macOS applications. This format handles plural forms, variable substitutions, and language-specific plural rules.

---

## Setting Up

First, make sure you've got a languine.json config file in your project root. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "locale": {
    "source": "en",
    "targets": ["sv", "de", "fr"]
  },
  "files": {
    "stringsdict": {
      "include": ["MyApp/Localizable.stringsdict"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Translating

With your config set, run:

```bash
npx languine@latest translate
```

When you run this command, Languine will:

- Load your Stringsdict files
- Detect any new or modified plural rules
- Generate translations for your target languages
- Update the Stringsdict files with new translations
- Handle complex plural rules for each language
- Maintain variable substitutions
- Preserve dictionary structure
- Support language-specific plural forms
- Validate plural rules consistency
- Keep formatting specifiers
