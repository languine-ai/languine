## First Translation

Now you are ready to translate your code.

Start by adding a key to your source file, for example if you choose to use `en.json` as your source file, add a key to it.

```json title="src/locales/en.json"
{
  "welcome": "Welcome to our application!",
  "user": {
    "greeting": "Hi, {{name}}!",
    "profile": {
      "title": "Your profile",
      "edit": "Edit profile"
    }
  },
  "notifications": {
    "messages": "You have {{count}} new message(s).",
    "empty": "No new notifications."
  }
}

```

## Translate

Run the following command to translate your content:

```bash title="Terminal"
npx languine@latest translate
```

## This will:
1. Create translation files for each target language
2. Generate high-quality translations Languine Engine
3. Create a `languine.lock` file to track translation states

The lock file helps Languine identify which translations need updates when your source content changes. Make sure to commit this file to your repository.

- Add more languages in your `languine.config.json` file
- Integrate Languine into your CI/CD pipeline
