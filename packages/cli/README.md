## What is Languine?

Languine helps developers to focus on building features, not wrestling with
localization challenges. With its robust tooling and AI capabilities, it
transforms what was once a tedious, manual process into an automated,
developer-friendly experience.

## Why use Languine?

- **AI-Powered Translations**: Generate accurate and context-aware translations
  across 100+ languages in seconds
- **Automation-First Approach**: Automatically update, add, or remove
  translations based on changes detected via Git diff
- **Consistent Localization**: Maintain uniform tone and style across all
  translated content
- **Developer-Centric Design**: Built with TypeScript, it integrates natively
  with version control systems and your preferred workflow
- **Time-Saving Workflows**: Organize, preview, and manage translation files
  directly from the command line

## What can it do?

### üîç Smart Detection

- Automatically identifies new, modified, or removed translation keys in your
  codebase using Git diff

  file-specific updates

### üåç AI-Powered Translation

- Leverages modern AI models to deliver contextually accurate translations
- Supports more than 100 languages with natural and consistent results
- Ensures that translations align with the tone and intent of your original text

### ü™ù Hooks
